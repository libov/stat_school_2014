# specify which data to generate
# distribution <function> <random number generator seed> <number of events> <parameter 1> <parameter 2> ...
# remarks: seed = 0 means unique random number chain is different on every run; seed != 0: chain is the same on every run
# pol3 parameters: all four parameters must be given, along with number of events. Polynomial obtained from four parameters is normalised to unity in order to obtain
# the probability density; the given number of events distributed according to this density is then generated
