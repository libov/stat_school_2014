** Mass peak fit tutorial C++/ROOT framework**

The framework is capable of generating of data and fitting it with the Minuit program.

I. In order to generate data according to some selected distribution, the "generate_data" program is used.
   Settings are given in a config file, which should be located in config/generate_data/ directory.
   The name of the config is passed to the program with help of --config option, e.g.

     ./generate_data --config gauss_pol0

   The following settings are given in the config file: output ROOT file name, histogram name, bin width, histogram range.
   Afterwards, the distributions are listed. E.g. one can generate a gaussian on a flat background. For that purpose, two lines should
   be given. See example in config/generate_data/gauss_pol0 and other files in that directory.
   The output file is stored under data/ and is used as input to the next step - the fit.

II. The program to fit the data generated in the first step is called "mass_peak_fit".
    The actual functionality is implemented in TMassPeakFit class, while mass_peak_fit program is a high-level wrapper that creates and steers an instance of this class.
    The program constructs a chi2 function and minimises it with respect to the fit function parameters, for example the mean and the width of the signal.  

    src/fit_functions.cxx: 		implementations of the fit functions (gauss, polynomial)
    src/minimization_functions.cxx:     implementations of the minimization approaches (neyman chi2, pearson chi2, poisson likelihood)
    src/Fit.cxx:			MOST IMPORTANT FILE for this tutorial. It contains actual Minuit commands that are executed, e.g. the minimisation itself (MIGRAD),
                                        calculation of the Hesse matrix (HESSE) or evaluation of fit errors (MINOS)
