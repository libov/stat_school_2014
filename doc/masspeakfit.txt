Intro Mass peak fit, figure and discussion
of all aspects

Signal estimation by eye.

Fit using minuit, Minuit intro
  - Purpose/Concept of Minuit
    FCN minimization FCN= chi2 etc.
    based on numerical Newton Raphson method
    sketch
  - Basic programme structure
  - Minuit main commands

Minuit standalone programme

 Output

Fit: g(p0,p1,p2) + p3

Task 1: fit p0 only (fix the rest)
- run the programme, understand the printout, vary printout level
- Fit quality control: - 2 ln L and Neyman chi2
- test convergence: run migrad twice
- different uncertainty estimates:
  - migrad
  - hesse
  - minos
  for low statistics and high statistics example
- test different mass binnings (small to large)
- discuss bin integration  

Task 2: fit p0 and p3
- Run the fit
- parameter errors from Hesse 
  and covariance ellipse 
- parameter errors from minos 
  and chi2+n*n contours
  -> profile likelihood concept
- vary fit range and see how p0 and p3 errors and 
  correlations change
- Compare different parameter estimation approaches:
  poisson lh
  Neyman chi2
  Pearson chi2
  Poisson lh variant approaching chi2 in large stat. limit (deviance)
  fill table with fitted parameters, errors and -2 ln L or chi2
  Discuss biases on normalisation
  Global normalisation constraint and fractions
- perhaps again one low and one high stat. example

Task 3: fit p1 (peak position)
- Introduction/motivation, e.g. Higgs mass
  crucial SM parameter, biases of mass measurements
  in collider detectors: e.g. for track based mass peak
  fits limited understanding/modelling of magnetic field inhomogenities
  etc.
- paper exercise with scan of mass peak position and chi2 fit,
  showing the problem of several local minima in chi2
- Fit exercise:
  fit p1 only:
  - bad start value
  - good start value
  fit p1 and p0:
  - bad start values
  - good start values
  Correlation of p1 and p0 and related uncertainty increase
  fit p1, p0 and p4:
  - bad start values
  - good start values

Task 4: fit p2 (width of peak)
- Introduction/motivation
  two contributions to observable width of peak
  1. natural width of particle, BW resonance, example phi resonance
  2. detector resolution
  many examples where 2 dominates, e.g. Dstar peak
  Often detector resolutions are not perfectly
  modelled by MC simulation, although it was already  
  tuned -> need to fit to the data.
  Often simplifying assumption for det. resolution: 
  single gaussian, this is usually only for reasonably
  small stat. justified, discuss more later
- Fit p2 only (fix the rest) resulting error is
  approximately p2 over sqrtn
- Fit p2 and p0, correlations/error increase
  use properly normalised gaussian and gaussian without 1/(2sqrtpi sigma)
  and compare different correlations
- Fit p2, p0 and p1 and correlations/error increase
- Fit p2, p0, p1 and p3
- Example data with 2 gaussian peak (e.g. K0s peak)
  fit g(p0,p1,p2)+g(p3,p4,p5)+p6
  Test with different start values

Task 5: Background 
- Introduction/motivation
  Background is almost unavoidable, different cases
  - well known SM background, e.g. elastic Jpsi production
    at HERA, lpair production is accurately known to NLO
  - often MC estimated background, sum of several
    sources, each on scaled e.g. using some control region
    e.g Drell Yan production at LHC.
  - often background is not really known, try to assess from 
    observed mass spectrum itself
  - Different background classes:
    - combinatorical background e.g. from pions produced
    in the fragmention of jets., smooth behaviour,
    phasespace effects, e.g for Dstar background in deltam
    - resonant background, e.g S0 in D0 > Kpi spectrum
      with missing pi0, or Kstar reflection in phi mass spectrum
      with pion wrongly taken as kaon.
    will assume for following example(s) unknown and purely combinatorical
    background
- fit data with g(p0,p1,p2) + p3 + p4 x + p5 x x  + p6 x x x 
  - p3 only for bgr
  - switch on step by step p4, p5 and b6, watch how
    -2 ln l and neyman chi2 change, wilkes theorem,
    only add parameter if significant drop of chi2, 
    compare results for
    signal and uncertainty for the different cases
  - vary fit range for a give parameterisation  
  - bgr parameterisation and fit range variations
    for assessment of signal systematics
  - Problem of large correlations between background
    parameters rho = -0.999, one possibility is to renormalise
    background function
  - Discuss relevance of fitting/not fitting the threshold region,
    in case of dstar it is important, but for the case that peak
    is far away from threshold it mignt be not helpful.
    Pure phasespace assumption often not correct, biases due to
    trigger selection, detector acceptances, etc.

Mention further mass peak examples/tasks
- double peak structure.
- Convolution of BW with resolution
- for high statistics one becomes more and more sensitive
  to tiny details of the spectrum and one might need to
  refine the fit model (add broad gaussian for resolution,
  reflection, etc.)
